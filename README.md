# Scavenger
Scavenger App - Demonstrates Xamarin integration with Unity, Orleans, and Azure

The Scavenger/Guide project is a scavenger hunt where the scavenger is a user with a phone who is guided by a second user with a desktop app. The destop app lays out eggs on a gui (using unity) with coordinates relative to the scavenger's actual location (xamarin app).

The server architecture uses Orleans to demostrate the actor model.

This project was written by Keith Rogers and Jacob Foulks as part of the Innovation Days program at Polaris. Have fun and let us know what you think. If you are curious to get a version of this up and running, or want to contribute, contact us directly - just so you can avoid unnecessary pain ;)
